# HFT Bot: Nuclear-Grade AI Trading System

## Overview
The HFT Bot is a high-frequency trading system designed for ultra-low latency trading. It leverages advanced technologies such as kernel-bypass I/O, GPU-accelerated inference, and robust risk management to achieve sub-10µs response times. This project is structured to facilitate high performance and scalability in trading environments.

## Core Components
1. **Data Feed Handler**: Utilizes Rust and io_uring for efficient market data parsing and GPU memory management.
2. **GPU Inference Engine**: Built with PyTorch and CUDA Graphs for high-performance model inference.
3. **Execution Engine**: Implements order management using the FIX protocol in Rust.
4. **Risk Manager**: Real-time risk assessment and auto-hedging capabilities using Python and Numba.

## Performance Targets
- Market Data RX: <3µs latency, 1M msgs/sec throughput
- GPU Inference: <5µs latency, 100K inferences/sec throughput
- Order TX: <5µs latency, 50K orders/sec throughput
- Risk Check: <0.5µs latency

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Rust (latest stable version)
- Python 3.11
- CUDA Toolkit (compatible version)
- Docker and Kubernetes (for deployment)

### Setup Instructions
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your/hft_bot.git
   ```
2. Set up the Python environment:
   ```
   cd hft_bot
   conda create -n hft python=3.11
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Build Rust libraries:
   ```
   cd libs/io_uring
   cargo build --release
   ```
4. Run the core system:
   ```
   python -m core.inference --config config/prod.yaml
   ```
